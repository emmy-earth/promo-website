            Most carbon accounting software only helps you with the easy part—steps 3 to 5 (calculations and reporting)—which is <strong>only 20% of the work</strong>. That leaves your team spending <strong>80% of their time</strong> struggling with manual data collection, cleaning, and entry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to the latest generative AI technology, Emmy covers the <strong>entire 5-step process</strong>. We eliminate the pain points of data collection and cleaning (<strong>steps 1 and 2</strong>), allowing you to <strong>automate 80% of the manual effort</strong> and get to accurate reporting faster than ever before.
